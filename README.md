# Overview

I wrote an attempt at a program which would determine if a string that the user entered was a palindrome or not. 

I wanted to write this because I thought that an object oriented program with 

# Development Environment

I used visual studio code as a place to develop the code, and I tried to run the code in the terminal itself, using a file that I downloaded from erlang's main site.

Erlang is a procedural language, and is determined to make life a little harder. it feels like a more archiac piece of language, where for loops are extinct, and 
variables must be purged before being reborn under a new value. it teaches the programmer a bit about recursion, and is very much something that exists in the terminal. from muy understanding, Erlang is very good at

* the user if it is indeed a plaindrome. After this, the program must remain open for a new response until the terminal is closed).
